mages come in a variety of different file formats, and each browser may support (or not support) different formats. By and large, the most commonly supported formats online are gif, jpg, and png images. Of these, the most widely used formats today are jpg and png. The jpg format provides quality images with high color counts while maintaining a decent file size, ideal for faster load times. The png format is great for images with transparencies or low color counts. We most commonly see jpg images used for photographs and png images used for icons or background patternsse.</p>

The <img> element is by default an inline-level element. Adding an image without any styles to a page will position that image within the same line as the content that surrounds it. Additionally, the height of the line in which an image appears will be changed to match the height of the image, which can create large vertical gaps within that line.
